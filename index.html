                  <p>
                    I've always been frugal.
                    Ever since I was a kid, whenever I'd come across money, I'd save it.
                    I remember the first time I reached $100.
                    It felt like I was Bill Gates.
                    So many things I could buy.
                    I could walk into a store, see something I like, and think, "I can buy this."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But I never did.
                    Whatever item I'd see on the shelves, I knew it wasn't worth falling below that $100 mark.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This carried on into my adulthood, where I still have a hard time spending money on items I don't need.
                    However, this is a severe problem for most people I have met.
                    People live paycheck to paycheck because they blow it all the moment they get paid, thinking every dollar in their bank account and wallet is "fun money".
                    This, however, is extremely dangerous and drastically decreases the qualify of life for most.

                    The most important thing when it comes to setting yourself up for financial success is making sure your income is always greater than your expenses.
                    You should always have <i>at least</i> 10% of your income left over after all your expenses are taken care of.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I don't make enough money to save 10%!" you might say.
                    Well, here's the good news.
                    There's more ways to increase savings than getting a higher paying job.
                    The easiest and quickest way is simply cut your expenses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sit down and actually look at where your money is going.
                    This might be a little harder if you pay for everything in cash, but who really does that these days?
                    Open up your bank statement and look at <i>every single purchase</i> you've made for the past couple of months.
                    Average them out and look at how much you're spending per month.
                    How much of that is from necessities and how much is from stuff you didn't need?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What is your biggest expense?
                    Eating out? Impulse buys? Unnecessarily large car payment?
                    Fast food is a big problem for a huge percentage of the general population.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Let's take our friend Jorge for example.
                    Jorge works 5 days a week.
                    Every time he's at work, he goes to Taco Bell for lunch and gets a $5 cravings deal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    No big deal right?
                    "It's just $5" he says.
                    Let's do the math.
                    Jorge works 5 days a week.
                    He spends $5 at Taco Bell each time.
                    That's $25 a week.
                    Multiply that by the 52 weeks that are in a year and our friend Jorge has spent $1,300 on fast food in a single year.
                    That's not even including taxes or breakfast or dinner.
                    Go to a more expensive restaurant like Chipotle and you're at over $2,000 a year easily.
                  </p>
                </span>

                  <p>
                    At this point you should have a pretty good idea of your monthly income and expenses.
                    The goal is to have as much as possible after expenses.
                    Like I mentioned previously, the easiest way to increase savings is to decrease expenses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Grab a piece of paper, open an excel sheet, whatever you want to use.
                    Create two columns.
                    Call one "Income" and the other "Expenses".
                  </p>
                  <br/>
                  <p>
                    <h3>Income</h3>
                    This is pretty self-explanatory and for most people will only include a single line, such as "Salary: $#,###".
                    If you have multiple sources of income, write them all.
                  </p>
                  <br/>
                  <p>
                    <h3>Expenses</h3>
                    This is where most people struggle.
                    Create categories for your expenses, such as "Rent", "Food", "Transportation", "Fun", "Misc".
                    Count <strong>every</strong> expense you incurred in your latest statement.
                    Even that $1 coffee from McDonald's.
                    It adds up.
                    Go through your bank statement with a magnifying glass if you have to.
                  </p>
                  <br/>
                  <p>
                    Once you're done adding your income and all your expenses, add them up and write the two totals at the bottom of the sheet.
                    Is your income greater than or at least equal to your expenses? Awesome.
                    If not, it's ok. We'll get you there.
                    Take a look at your expenses.
                    Are there any numbers that stand out?
                    Is there a category where you're spending a lot more than you thought you were?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is where creating a budget comes in handy.
                    Go through your expenses.
                    Where can you lower expenses?
                    Maybe you're eating out too much instead of cooking at home.
                    Maybe your closet keeps getting full of new clothes you never wear.
                    Or maybe you just can't stop buying random things every time you go to the store.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Go through each category and set limits.
                    It's ok if you can't cut back as much as you'd like at first.
                    Start off with a $50 limit a month on eating out, then gradually reduce it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I recommend downloading an app like <a href='https://www.mint.com/' target='_blank'>Mint</a> and using it religiously to track your spending.
                  </p>

                    Spend a few weeks following this advice and watch your net worth shoot up.
                    Look into contributing to a Roth IRA and your 401k.
                    More information on that coming soon. :)
